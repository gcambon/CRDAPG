% prepare CTD data against time for LADCP
%
% we need a vector 'timctd' with the time of the CTD in Julian days
% and an array 'data' with the 3 columns
% pressure in dbar    in situ temperature in degrees C    salinity in psu
%
% THIS FILE IS CRUISE SPECIFIC
%
% to create a file for your own cruise, modify this file
%
% the data should typically be the data recorded during a CTD
% cast in about 1 second steps
% it will be used to calculate the depth of the LADCP system

% if you do no have CTD time data to be used in the
% LADCP processing, uncomment the next two lines, otherwise edit the following


%
% first copy CTD time data to raw CTD data directory
% data/raw_ctdtime
% this data could e.g. be coming from a mounted disk like in
% the example below
%
% uncomment the following and MODIFY it, 
% if you have the raw data stored elsewher
% and want to copy it to the ADCP processing
%

%
% load this data and convert to standard format
% we need the data:
%
% time in decimal julian days ( January 1, 2000 = 2451545 )
% pressure in dbar
% in situ temperature in degrees C
% salinity in psu
%
% time is stored as acolumn vector in 'timctd'
% the other variables as columns PTS in the array 'data'
%
%
% in this example
% we skip the header of the file and extract the PTS columns
% into 'data' and the time vector into 'timctd'
%
% you might have to convert depth to pressure in dbar
% and/or conductivity to salinity
%
% and you will have to make sure that the time is stored in Julian days
%
% in this example we add the julian day January 0 of the year of the
% cast to the time stored in the file
% THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR SEABIRD CNV FILES that contain the
% variable 'time in julian days'

% the pressure data on one of our cruises had some spikes which
% could be removed by the following
% If your data quality is already good, you won't need the
% following lines. If it is bad you will need do create your
% own despiking.

%
% In our example the CTD cast recording began a bit before the
% actual down movement of the CTD. We want only the real
% down and uptrace of the cast. A good part of this will be
% done again in the main processing, but sometimes those
% routines failed and it was simple enough to do here.
%
% The extraction of this part is sometimes tricky. You might
% have to 'invent' your own methods to make sure that only the
% cast is extracted.
%
% Here we cut start and end of profiles to when CTD is under water
% This is done by taking the maximum pressure
% finding the two values closest to half of this pressure
% on the up and the down casts and go towards the
% surface on up and down casts until salinity is lower than 10.0

% The following might not be necessary. But we needed it
