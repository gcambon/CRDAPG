# CRDAP for Cruise Repository for Data Acquisition and Processing

## Introduction

This repository allows you to create all the directories and scripts for processing data acquired at sea during an oceanographic cruise.

Within this repository we will find several branches, each corresponding to the different acquisition systems present on each research vessel.

The master branch is the most up-to-date.

## Purpose

During an oceanographic cruise, we use our own instruments and those available on board. Data acquisition systems and their formats are generally heterogeneous.

In order to simplify data processing and validation, we have implemented in the last few years an information system that allows us to structure and give easy access to data and real-time control. This system can be adapted to any vessel and duplicated upon return to the laboratory to finalize processing, data adjustment and product delivery.
